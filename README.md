# AceBread ROM
A project created in back in 2016 but abandoned the same year without any public release. Recently, I decided to compile and release my work on this ROM to the public.
AceBread is a project based on Samsung's stock Gingerbread ROM for the GALAXY Ace. It aims for a lightweight (less than 50Mo) and fast ROM that integrates some changes to the stock base.

# Encountered bugs :

**Note : I will try to get Framework-res.apk to work on the next release as it crashes the device when flashed. Not sure if it is a framework specific bug or if this version of Android does not support the changes.**
